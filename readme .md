I have left the routing to one port which is 8000
when running we can use ngrok port 8000
And we can also access the admin panel via http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login
 
inorder to access the admin side using under ngrok
I user will have to add the admin slashs e.g. https://e4a28a2970ec.ngrok-free.app/admin/login
