# Uniform Vehicle Card Image Sizing Implementation

## Overview
This implementation ensures all vehicle images across the car dealership website have uniform sizes and consistent appearance, creating a professional and polished look.

## Changes Made

### 1. CSS Styling Updates (`public/assets/css/style.css`)

#### **Enhanced Image Display**
- **Fixed Height**: All vehicle images have a consistent height of 250px (desktop)
- **Object Fit**: Uses `object-fit: cover` for optimal display (images are now properly cropped in admin)
- **Professional Cropping**: Admin panel includes aspect ratio editing tools
- **Responsive Design**: 
  - Desktop: 250px height
  - Tablet (768px): 200px height  
  - Mobile (576px): 180px height

#### **Card Layout Improvements**
- **Flexbox Layout**: Cards use flexbox for consistent heights
- **Equal Card Heights**: All cards in a row have the same height
- **Consistent Spacing**: Uniform padding and margins

#### **Enhanced Visual Effects**
- **Smooth Transitions**: 0.4s ease transitions for all hover effects
- **Hover Animations**: Subtle scale and lift effects on hover
- **Professional Shadows**: Enhanced box shadows for depth

### 2. Component Updates

#### **Vehicle Card Component** (`resources/views/components/shared/vehicle-card.blade.php`)
- Updated placeholder image to use SVG format
- Maintains existing structure for compatibility

#### **Hot Deals Card Component** (`resources/views/components/shared/hot-deals-card.blade.php`)
- Added Quick View functionality
- Updated placeholder image to use SVG format
- Consistent with main vehicle card structure

#### **Quick View Section** (`resources/views/components/home/quick-view-section.blade.php`)
- Already had correct structure
- Uses same uniform styling

### 3. SVG Placeholder Image
- **Created**: `public/assets/images/placeholder-vehicle.svg`
- **Purpose**: Professional placeholder for vehicles without images
- **Design**: Clean, modern car icon with gradient background
